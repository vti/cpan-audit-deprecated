# DESCRIPTION

`cpan-audit` is a command line application that checks the modules or distributions for known vulnerabilities. It is using
its internal database that is automatically generated from a hand-picked database
[https://github.com/vti/cpan-security-advisory](https://github.com/vti/cpan-security-advisory).

`cpan-audit` does not connect to anything, that is why it is important to keep it up to date. Every update of the internal
database is released as a new version.

`cpan-audit` can automatically detect dependencies from the following sources:

- `Carton`

    Parses `cpanfile.snapshot` file and checks the distribution versions.

- `cpanfile`

    Parses `cpanfile` taking into account the required versions.

It is assumed that if the required version of the module is less than a version of a release with a known vulnerability
fix, then the module is considered affected.
